# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a browser-based web game created as part of my journey through The Odin Project curriculum. This is my ninth project, and it focuses on building a dynamic and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows two players to play the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, with features such as win detection, draw detection, and the ability to start a new game.

## How to Use

- 🎮 **Play the Game:** Click on any empty cell on the board to place your "X" or "O" and try to win the game.
- 🏆 **Winning:** The game will detect when a player has won and display a modal dialog showing the result.
- 🔄 **New Game:** After the game ends, click the "New Game" button to reset the board and start over.

## Technologies Used

- 🎨 `styles.css`: The stylesheet that defines the layout and design of the game.
- 📜 `script.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the game logic, including checking for a win and updating the board.

## Learning Objectives

This project was built with the following objectives:
